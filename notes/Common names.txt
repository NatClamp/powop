To do common names properly, including showing references:

- The data model will need changing.
  /world-flora-model/src/main/java/org/emonocot/model/VernacularName.java
  doesn't have a Set<References> references property, so the data
  model would need changing â€” see Distribution.

- Then, the harvester needs changing.  See
  /world-flora-harvest/src/main/java/org/emonocot/job/dwc/distribution/FieldSetMapper.java
  for how distributions work.

- Then, the portal view function in
  /world-flora-portal/src/main/java/org/emonocot/portal/view/bibliography/SimpleBibliographyImpl.java
  needs updating to add bibliography entries from vernacular names in #setReferences.

- Finally, the view itself
  /world-flora-portal/src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/views/taxon/show.jspx
  needs updating to include the bibliographic citations.
