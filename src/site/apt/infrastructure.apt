Infrastructure

 The current eMonocot infrastructure consists of

 * {{http://jenkins.ad.kew.org}} â€” continuous integration server

 * UAT servers (separate servers for Apache, Tomcat, Solr, MySQL)

 * Production servers (separate servers for Apache, Tomcat, Solr, MySQL)

Bare Metal install using KickStart

  <<This section is out of date.>>

 * Mount the installation image found {{{http://mirror.ox.ac.uk/sites/mirror.centos.org/5/isos/x86_64/CentOS-5.9-x86_64-netinstall.iso}here}} on the server
 
 * On first boot, boot from the cdrom and at the prompt type <<<linux text ks=http://build.e-monocot.org/ks/name-of-server.cfg>>> to use the kickstart file to
   configure the server
   
 * Depending on whether the networking uses DHCP or a manually assigned IP address, you may need to configure the network details, anaconda will prompt you to do so.
 
 * Once the operating system has been installed and the server has restarted, on the puppetmaster ({{{http://build.e-monocot.org/}build.e-monocot.org}}) check for the
   certificate signing request from the newly installed server <<<sudo puppet cert --list>>>
   
 * The puppet certificate authority should list the names of servers which have made new certificate requests
 
 * Now  sign the certificate <<<sudo puppet cert sign nameofserver>>>
 
 * Your server needs to be added to /etc/puppet/auth.conf in order to be able to access some files stored on the puppetmaster
 
 * Either start the puppet service and wait for the puppet changes to propagate or run <<<sudo puppet agent --test>>> on the server to see the changes applied instantly.

   * <<<rsync -avr username@build.e-monocot.org:/mnt/shared/snapshots/daily.0/zoo-bclark04/mysql/mysqldump.sql.gz .>>>
   
   * <<<gunzip mysqldump.sql.gz>>>
   
   * <<<mysql -uemonocot-user -peM0n0c0t emonocot < mysqldump.sql>>>
   
   * <<<rsync -avr username@build.e-monocot.org:/mnt/shared/snapshots/daily.0/zoo-bclark04/mysql/gis.sql.gz .>>>
   
   * <<<gunzip gis.sql.gz>>>
